</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>To finish off the wingtips, I cut off the spars at an angle and cut some
tip skins based on the plans. These were glued and pinned into place
then sanded to provide a smooth finish and to blend in with the leading
and trailing edges.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_145&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-14-03-41/"><img alt="Wingtips sheeted and sanded" class="size-full wp-image-145" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-14.03.41.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Wingtips sheeted and sanded[/caption]</p>
<p>With the tips finished I drilled holes into the inner three ribs of each
wing. This was a process that would have been much easier earlier on,
but would have resulted in the ribs being delicate and fiddly until the
skin on this section was added. The first wing went fairly smoothly, but
the spars on the second were slightly closer-spaced, resulting in my
drill bit catching and breaking one of the ribs. This was easy enough to
repair but frustrating.</p>
<p>I couldn't find any tubing exactly the right size to take the wing
joiner, so I settled for taking some undersized tubing and cutting a
slit in it to allow it to expand slightly. Cutting this with a rotary
tool worked but was messy and went through several cutting discs.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_147&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-20-49-24/"><img alt="Slotted aluminium tubing" class="size-full wp-image-147" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.49.24.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Slotted aluminium tubing[/caption]</p>
<p>I first test fitted the tubing to make sure it the wing joiner would
fit. Then I wrapped it in tape to make it easier to remove should I need
to, before epoxying it into the slot in the wing. Once both wings were
done I installed the joiner as a test only to find there was a slight
misalignment that I'd missed. I was glad of the tape at this point as it
made it much easier to remove the tubing before re-drilling and
refitting the tubing!</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_149&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-21-20-17-2/"><img alt="Wing joiner tube" class="size-full wp-image-149" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-21.20.171.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /></a> Wing joiner tube[/caption]</p>
<p>Once the joiner tube was in place and both wings lined up I cut some
wood for the sheeting on the inner section of the wing. This was quite
straightforward as the shapes were simple and the dimensions could be
directly taken from the wing. Once these were cured I glued on the 1/32&quot;
ply faceplates to the root rib, using the wing jointer to align them.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_150&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-21-40-52/"><img alt="Finished wing root" class="size-full wp-image-150" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-21.40.52.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Finished wing root[/caption]</p>

<p>With the wings complete it was time to cover them. As usual I used an
iron on film, in this case LightTex. I prefer to tack the film to the
trailing and leading edges first, to avoid it moving about. After this,
I worked from one end of the wing to the other to avoid the shrinking
film creating too much tension and pulling a warp into the wing.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_154&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-17-15-39-04/"><img alt="Original decals" class="size-full wp-image-154" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-17-15.39.04.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Original decals[/caption]</p>
<p>I kept the original decals from the previous model when I removed the
covering, and my initial plan was to reuse all of these on the new
model. Unfortunately the covering that the second of the larger decals
was attached to began to disintegrate when I attempted to remove it so I
was left with only one good decal.</p>
<p>To deal with this I decided to trace out the lines of the decal and
create my own from some left over red and black covering film that I
had. This worked surprisingly well and I decided to remove the other of
the larger decals and use the same technique on the first wing also.</p>
<p>[gallery ids=&quot;155,156,158&quot;]</p>
<p>After tracing, I transferred the lines onto some paper and cut them out
neatly. This provided a template that could be taped to some covering
film and cut out with a sharp craft knife. I did this for the swirl and
the individual letters, then arranged them on the wing. To iron them
down I covered the sealing iron with a sock. This was to prevent the
small pieces of film from shrivelling and attaching their adhesive side
to the iron.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_157&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-17-15-59-13/"><img alt="Finished Swirl Decal" class="size-full wp-image-157" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-17-15.59.13.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Finished Swirl Decal[/caption]</p>
<p>I lost some detail in the decals by using this method, but it still
looks good. The original decals looked quite messy due to air bubbles
under the transparent parts and dust getting stuck to the adhesive
around the edges.</p>
