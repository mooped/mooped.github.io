glider. I'd originally intended to &amp;nbsp;use the existing fuselage and just
straighten it up. Unfortunately, when I came to look at it closer the
plywood construction had warped more than I thought. I started trying to
disassemble it with a view to re-glueing but it quickly fell apart, at
this point it became even more obvious that the original ply was just
too warped to be useful. I took the decision to build a new fuselage
using as many of the existing parts as possible, but using balsa instead
of ply for the majority of the structure. I decided it should be
possible to build a structure with equivalent strength this way, with
similar or less weight and less tendency to warp if stored for a long
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_168&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;460&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-07-18-54-14/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Twisty Fuselage" class="size-full wp-image-168" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-07-18.54.14.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Twisty Fuselage[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to trace out the layout of the fuselage from the
plans. This was tricky because the way the plans were folded (in the
original packaging) they would not sit flat. They had to be stretched
very tightly to avoid introducing curves into the lines. I took account
of this when tracing and did a second pass using measurements from the
plan and filling in the straight edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_169&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-09-21-21-24/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tracing the fuselage parts" class="size-full wp-image-169" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-21.21.24.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tracing the fuselage parts[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was happy with the outlines I traced them onto some balsa. The
fuselage sides were cut at the same time by pinning and double sided
taping two sheets together, in order to ensure that they matched. The
edges were then sanded before detaching the sheets. Because my wings
have a slightly longer chord I had to transfer some measurements from
the new wings onto the fuselage sides. I then used the markings on the
fuselage sides to determine the length of the top sheeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_171&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;460&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-09-21-58-38/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Taking measurements from the new wings" class="size-full wp-image-171" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-21.58.38.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Taking measurements from the new
wings[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to reuse the original fuselage formers. In the course of
removing the glue from them the wood began to crumble, also the
thickness of the side sheeting had changed necessitating different
dimensions for the formers. I built a servo tray shelf from thick balsa
instead of ply to avoid the difficulties of cutting this part out of
ply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_172&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-10-12-50-07/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Original and new formers" class="size-full wp-image-172" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-10-12.50.07.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Original and new formers[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_173&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;460&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-10-13-06-27/"&gt;&lt;img alt="New front former" class="size-full wp-image-173" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-10-13.06.27.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; New front former[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the front section of the fuselage I cut some 1/32&amp;quot; ply formers to
add back some strength. The were overlapped with the front former but
did not go beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_176&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-10-14-00-18/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ply doublers" class="size-full wp-image-176" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-10-14.00.18.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ply doublers[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then fitted the new formers using blocks to make sure they were at
right angles with the fuselage sides. The rear of the doublers was glued
into place at this point, but the remainder was left unglued to make it
easy to add curvature to this section later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_178&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-10-14-20-07/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fitting the formers and doublers" class="size-full wp-image-178" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-10-14.20.07.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fitting the formers and doublers[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the glue was cured the other side of the fuselage was fitted to the
formers, again ensuring that everything was held perpendicular. Once
this was set I put the fuselage upside down and began fitting the bottom
sheeting, making sure that the fuselage sides were vertical at each
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_180&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-10-17-19-12/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding the bottom sheeting" class="size-full wp-image-180" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-10-17.19.12.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Adding the bottom sheeting[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the majority of the fuselage bottom sheeting installed I had to fit
pushrods before closing this area up. A sharpened aluminium tube worked
well to drill out the angle pushrod exit holes in the fuselage. The
pushrod outer tubing was roughed up and epoxied into place at the rear
of the fuselage and held in place with rubber tubing at the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;quot;182,183,184&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom sheeting in the nose section is thicker than in other areas
and is sanded to provide a curved shape. I first traced out the shape I
wanted and pinned and glued the fuselage sides into position using this
template. I also glued the rest of the doublers down at this point to
help maintain the curvature. Once the glue was cured I trimmed the
bottom sheeting to shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_186&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-14-20-56-44/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nose bottom sheeting" class="size-full wp-image-186" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-14-20.56.44.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nose bottom sheeting[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a servo tray in the nose section of the fuselage I transferred
the dimensions of the rear part of the tray (attached to the former) to
a square stick of wood. I then used a servo and a piece of 3/16 sheet
that would become the front of the tray to mark out the required
dimensions. I used the stick to mark the inside of the fuselage sides
with the tray position, then used pins to transfer these marks to the
outside. Cutting a slot between the marks gave me a firm mounting for
the front of the servo tray. This was glued in after the servos were
screwed into it to maintain good alignment with the rear of the tray.
The ends of this piece were then trimmed and sanded flush with the
fuselage sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;quot;190,191,192&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the nose of the glider I first installed a ply former between
the fronts of the fuselage sides. I the attached a stack of 3/16&amp;quot; balsa
forming the rough shape of the glider's nose. These were hacked roughly
to shape with a razor saw before being sanded to a smooth shape that I
was happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery columns=&amp;quot;4&amp;quot; ids=&amp;quot;194,195,197,199&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wing saddle area felt a little flimsy so it was reinforced with two
sections of 1/4&amp;quot; square section balsa on either side. These should help
transfer loads across this section of the model and provide a sturdier
support for the wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_193&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-17-23-21-28/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reinforcing the wing saddle" class="size-full wp-image-193" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-17-23.21.28.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reinforcing the wing
saddle[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the nose, I built up a block of balsa at the very rear of the
glider and sanded it to shape. This gives a neat finish to the tail as
well as hopefully absorbing any impacts during transport and handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_196&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-20-19-59-36/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tail block" class="size-full wp-image-196" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20-19.59.36.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tail block[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fin was fitted last to avoid bashing it while working on other parts
of the model. I was glued into a slot in the top sheeting, and held in
place with blocks while the glue cured. I used the original fin as this
part was still intact and straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_200&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-20-21-31-06/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fin installation" class="size-full wp-image-200" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20-21.31.06.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fin installation[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covering the fuselage was a straightforward process as there are no open
sections to cover over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_201&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot;
width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/24/glider-restoration-part-3-fuselage/2013-02-21-22-04-07/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Covering" class="size-full wp-image-201" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-21-22.04.07.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Covering[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the majority of the fuselage built I fitted the original rudder and
stabiliser to the model. The rudder was fitted with 3M Blenderm tape
which makes an excellent hinge. The stabiliser and wings are intended to
be held on with thick rubber bands, I need to go out and buy some
stronger bands before flying the model. After centering the servos I
trimmed the pushrods to length and fitted clevises, then tested the
amount of force required to move the control surfaces. The rudder
required quite a bit of force so I moved the control horn lower down on
the rudder to better suit the angle of the pushrod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don't have access to a decent slope or any good means of
launching the model as a pure glider. The HiFly comes with a motor pod
that sits above the wing so it can be flown as a powered glider. I've
assembled the pod, but I'm waiting on the arrival of a motor before I
can fly it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was able to fully assemble the model, which took up a
lot more space than I remember. Various parts like the canopy and the
stabiliser were reused from the original model. Once the motor arrives
(hopefully next week) I'll be able to give it a test flight assuming the
weather cooperates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_203&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot;

and trailing edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_145&amp;quot; align â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To finish off the wingtips, I cut off the spars at an angle and cut some

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_145&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-14-03-41/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wingtips sheeted and sanded" class="size-full wp-image-145" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-14.03.41.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wingtips sheeted and sanded[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the tips finished I drilled holes into the inner three ribs of each
wing. This was a process that would have been much easier earlier on,
but would have resulted in the ribs being delicate and fiddly until the
skin on this section was added. The first wing went fairly smoothly, but
the spars on the second were slightly closer-spaced, resulting in my
drill bit catching and breaking one of the ribs. This was easy enough to
repair but frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find any tubing exactly the right size to take the wing
joiner, so I settled for taking some undersized tubing and cutting a
slit in it to allow it to expand slightly. Cutting this with a rotary
tool worked but was messy and went through several cutting discs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_147&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-20-49-24/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slotted aluminium tubing" class="size-full wp-image-147" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-20.49.24.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Slotted aluminium tubing[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first test fitted the tubing to make sure it the wing joiner would
fit. Then I wrapped it in tape to make it easier to remove should I need
to, before epoxying it into the slot in the wing. Once both wings were
done I installed the joiner as a test only to find there was a slight
misalignment that I'd missed. I was glad of the tape at this point as it
made it much easier to remove the tubing before re-drilling and
refitting the tubing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_149&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;460&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-21-20-17-2/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wing joiner tube" class="size-full wp-image-149" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-21.20.171.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wing joiner tube[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the joiner tube was in place and both wings lined up I cut some
wood for the sheeting on the inner section of the wing. This was quite
straightforward as the shapes were simple and the dimensions could be
directly taken from the wing. Once these were cured I glued on the 1/32&amp;quot;
ply faceplates to the root rib, using the wing jointer to align them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_150&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-21-40-52/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Finished wing root" class="size-full wp-image-150" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-21.40.52.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finished wing root[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_151&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-03-22-39-01/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Finished wing structure" class="size-full wp-image-151" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-03-22.39.01.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finished wing structure[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wings complete it was time to cover them. As usual I used an
iron on film, in this case LightTex. I prefer to tack the film to the
trailing and leading edges first, to avoid it moving about. After this,
I worked from one end of the wing to the other to avoid the shrinking
film creating too much tension and pulling a warp into the wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_154&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-17-15-39-04/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Original decals" class="size-full wp-image-154" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-17-15.39.04.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Original decals[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept the original decals from the previous model when I removed the
covering, and my initial plan was to reuse all of these on the new
model. Unfortunately the covering that the second of the larger decals
was attached to began to disintegrate when I attempted to remove it so I
was left with only one good decal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deal with this I decided to trace out the lines of the decal and
create my own from some left over red and black covering film that I
had. This worked surprisingly well and I decided to remove the other of
the larger decals and use the same technique on the first wing also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids=&amp;quot;155,156,158&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tracing, I transferred the lines onto some paper and cut them out
neatly. This provided a template that could be taped to some covering
film and cut out with a sharp craft knife. I did this for the swirl and
the individual letters, then arranged them on the wing. To iron them
down I covered the sealing iron with a sock. This was to prevent the
small pieces of film from shrivelling and attaching their adhesive side
to the iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_157&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/19/glider-restoration-part-2-finishing-the-wings/2013-02-17-15-59-13/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Finished Swirl Decal" class="size-full wp-image-157" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-17-15.59.13.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Finished Swirl Decal[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost some detail in the decals by using this method, but it still
looks good. The original decals looked quite messy due to air bubbles
under the transparent parts and dust getting stuck to the adhesive
around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;

repaired for years now. I originally built it with my dad. Well, he did
most of the building; I suspect my main contribution was nagging him to
get it finished. Unfortunately, we didn't really know what we were
doing, and it took some damage after very little flight time. We
attempted to use a plastic AA battery box which broke as we launched the
glider and left us with no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_116&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/dsc00256-2/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Before" class="size-full wp-image-116" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC002561.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Before[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nose of the model was damaged when it landed, and it was put in
storage for many years, during which the wings got warped. A year or so
ago I decided to restore it, I finally made a start on it last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to completely rebuild the wings, as the warp in the originals
was enough that it would be very difficult to remove without weakening
them. First off I dug out the plans and found an image showing the
typical wing section. I traced this in Draftsight to provide the shape
for the various wing ribs. The tip ribs where the wing tapers had to be
generated by measuring the plan, then scaling and fixing up the slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_105&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1160&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/screen-shot-2013-02-02-at-21-51-38/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ribs redrawn in Draftsight" class="size-full wp-image-105" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-shot-2013-02-02-at-21.51.38.png" style="width: 1160px; height: 574px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ribs redrawn in Draftsight[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately in my hurry to get the ribs cut I drew them in a hurry and
made a few mistakes. I missed the asymmetrical spar slots on the inner
ribs and added a slot where the shear webs were drawn on the plan,
leaving me with two part ribs. I didn't catch this before laser cutting
the parts, but I was able to work around the problems and avoid wasting
the cut parts. I guess the moral of the story is &amp;quot;Don't design in a
hurry&amp;quot;. The drawing shown above includes the corrections I made later.
The thin ply end plates had to be cut by hand around a template as I
couldn't find laser safe 1/32&amp;quot; ply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_117&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-22-23-50-10/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cut ribs" class="wp-image-117" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-22-23.50.10.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cut ribs[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I traced the plan onto some greaseproof paper since the original plan
was too creased to build on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_118&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;460&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-27-17-28-48-2/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Layout" class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-27-17.28.481.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Layout[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual wings went together fairly quickly once I got started. The
spars were pinned to the board and the 1/8th inch ply and balsa inner
ribs were laid on top. They were packed to sit level because they're cut
1/16th of an inch undersize so they can be sheeted later. I then added
then top spar and supported it at the other end. A small template was
used to set the angle of the root rib, to give the wing the correct
amount of dihedral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_120&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-27-18-03-30-2/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inner ribs" class="size-full wp-image-120" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-27-18.03.301.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Inner ribs[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between each pair of ribs is a shear web that locks the spars together,
and prevents the wing from twisting or flexing. These came in handy to
hold the front end of the ribs in place, meanwhile the rear ends of the
ribs were pinned. A set of building block blanks from Homebase came in
handy to make sure everything was square. I tend to clamp them to parts
until the glue sets to keep them oriented correctly. Fortunately I had
enough clamps that by the time I ran out the glue on the first pieces
was dry, so the clamps could be reused and the build went fairly
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_122&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-02-01-20-47-03/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lots of clamps" class="size-full wp-image-122" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-01-20.47.03.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Lots of clamps[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the rear ribs were in place, I marked the positions of their ends
on a piece of trailing edge stock. I cut out notches then glued and
pinned it to the board. This kept the rear ribs safe while I moved on to
the front section of the wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the mistakes I made when drawing the parts, the inner ribs were
1/16th of an inch longer than the outer ribs. To work around this I
glued a strip of 1/16th balsa to the rear of the leading edge stock I
was using, stopping where it met the inner ribs. I glued this to the
inner ribs and pinned and clamped it in place, then installed the front
rib half at the tip of the wing. This had to be clamped in in place with
a pair of building blocks to keep it at the right angle. I then pinned
the leading edge to the board to make sure it was straight according to
my drawn layout before fitting the rest of the front rib halves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_123&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;460&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-27-20-57-55-3/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Front rib halves" class="size-full wp-image-123" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-27-20.57.552.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Front rib halves[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ribs were installed, I had to do some sanding to fix my design
mistakes. I then fitted a piece of sheeting between the spar and the
leading edge on the top side of the wing. This is designed to be glued
into the top of the leading edge and then sanded to blend it in later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_124&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignnone&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;1024&amp;quot;]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-02-02-18-42-40/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leading edge sheeting" class="size-full wp-image-124" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-02-18.42.40.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Leading edge sheeting[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once sanded, the sheeting gives a very neat and uniform look, which
hides many of the problems caused by the drawing issues. The curved tips
play a perspective trick in the photo above, making the sheeting look
flatter than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next task on the wings is to build up the tips and install the inner
sheeting. I also need to drill a hole in the inner ribs to hold a tube
into which the wire wing joiner will slide. Later, I will need to fix up
the fuselage, but this should be a simpler job.&lt;/p&gt;
