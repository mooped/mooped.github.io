</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I got close to biting off more than I could chew recently in the process
of making a Secret Santa gift. &nbsp;With Mata as my 'victim' I decided to
make some little action figures of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.matazone.co.uk/animpages/kitty1.html">Mittens and
Snowdrop</a>&nbsp;characters
from one of his animations.</p>
<p>The initial plan was to just build and paint the figures, but partway
through I decided to cast them in resin. &nbsp;This has the advantage of
being stronger than the master model (depending on materials) and as a
bonus let me make a set for myself.</p>
<p>First up, here's the finished product:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-17-19-50-12/"><img alt="Finished Product" class="wp-image-83" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-17-19-50-12.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>To start off with I decided to have some fun, and ended up building a
mini lathe to make the basic body shape. &nbsp;This allowed me to use cheap
3/4 inch balsa dowel as stock material instead of wasting (slightly
more) expensive putty, it also made getting the body shape smooth and
uniform a lot easier.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-05-20-41-33/"><img alt="Mini lathe in action" class="size-full wp-image-73" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-05-20-41-33.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>The lathe is very light duty but works well to shape a piece of balsa
with sandpaper or a craft knife. There's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/23/diy-mini-lathe/">separate blog
post</a> on
how I made the lathe.</p>
<p>Once I had the body shape I started adding details. &nbsp;Mittens' mouth was
just cut out with a razor saw and then the throat drilled out. After
that, a lip and uvula were sculpted with Milliput epoxy putty. &nbsp;Eyes and
feet were added in a similar fashion over several days to allow the
putty to cure and prevent accidental damage to bits of detail that were
still setting.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-07-06-18-45/"><img alt="Basic Body Shapes" class="size-full wp-image-74" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-07-06-18-45.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>More complex features such as Mittens' hands and the ears were made by
rolling out sheets of putty and cutting it to shape with a sharp
sculpting tool. &nbsp;In the case of the ears they were rolled onto a curved
bit of clay and cut to shape then allowed to cure and trimmed down to
size before being attached with fillets of putty.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-12-06-35-41/"><img alt="Masters" class="size-full wp-image-75" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-12-06-35-41.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>Once the masters were finished I brushed them with polyurethane varnish
to ensure they'd release cleanly from the mould. &nbsp;I should have used
some filler at this point to get rid of the woodgrain finish, but since
I didn't think about it at the time I had to clean this up later.</p>
<p>I ordered some RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanising) silicone rubber online
in order to make the mould. &nbsp;The correct way to make a two part mould is
to build a box and fill the bottom half with clay, then press the
masters into the clay and pour silicone over. &nbsp;Unfortunately the clay I
had dried up, so I ended up using salt dough and surprisingly it worked
well though it was very soft.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-12-22-15-35/"><img alt="The first mould half is poured" class="size-full wp-image-76" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-12-22-15-35.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>I build the mould box out of cardboard protected with parcel tape. &nbsp;The
base is some 0.5mm sheet styrene I had lying around. &nbsp;The card was just
formed into a box and taped closed I packed the bottom half with salt
dough. &nbsp;I added more dough around the box to seal the edges. &nbsp;The master
models were then pressed into the dough making sure there was a tight
enough seal all around. &nbsp;I then mixed up the silicone thoroughly and
poured it from as high as possible. It's best to pour into the corner of
the mould and allow it to flow over the models of its own accord to
prevent air bubbles and voids in the mould.</p>
<p>To make it easy to line up the two mould halves it's worth pressing the
handle of a paint brush or similar into the clay to make some small
alignment nubs in the first mould half. &nbsp;These will translate to
matching holes in the second half. &nbsp;I made once larger than the others
to make it obvious which corners should match up.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-13-21-24-31/"><img alt="First mould half" class="size-full wp-image-77" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-13-21-24-31.jpeg" style="width: 941px; height: 768px;" /></a></p>
<p>After leaving this overnight I removed the box and washed off the salt
dough from the models. &nbsp;A downside of the salt dough is that it gets
very sticky but it wasn't difficult to remove. &nbsp;Although it's advised
against I cracked part of one of the models out of the mould to check
that it released properly.</p>
<p>Before pouring the second half of the mould I painted a thin layer of
Vaseline over the rubber (but not the models) to act as a mould release
and avoid the two halves bonding together. &nbsp;I realised at this point
that I hadn't added any vents or pour channels into the mould so I had
to hack them in with some clay. &nbsp;These would have been much easier to
add when making the first mould half as they could be set into the clay.
&nbsp;The Vaseline didn't help either as everything was very slippy at this
point.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-13-21-47-51/"><img alt="Adding vents (a little late)" class="size-full wp-image-78" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-13-21-47-51.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>The second mould half was then poured in a similar fashion to the first.
&nbsp;A day later once it had cured I cracked open the box and managed to
separate the two mould halves with relatively little hack and slash with
the craft knife.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-14-23-04-24/"><img alt="Completed mould" class="size-full wp-image-79" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-14-23-04-24.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 710px;" /></a></p>
<p>Once the mould was complete I mixed up some resin and did a test pour.
&nbsp;The results were quite promising but highlighted a few flaws in the
mould. &nbsp;The pour channels had to be opened up a bit with the craft knife
to let more resin in. &nbsp;Additionally since the feet were above the point
where the pour channel hits the body they trapped pockets of air. &nbsp;I
solved this by skewering the silicone with a cocktail stick through to
the tips of the feet and inserting some 'biro inner' style nylon tube to
prevent the channels from closing up. &nbsp;The resin doesn't stick to the
nylon so they can be easily removed with some pliers, leaving a little
stick of cast resin which easily breaks off (useful for parts that can't
be aligned with the mould line).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-15-01-09-58/"><img alt="Pouring the resin" class="size-full wp-image-80" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-15-01-09-58.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>I used some more sheet styrene and elastic bands to hold the mould shut.
&nbsp;It doesn't need too much pressure as the resin is quite thick and you
can warp the mould.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the resin and silicone I used required mixing in
roughly 10:1 ratio with a catalyst, which required some very accurate
scales. &nbsp;It's possible to get stuff that can be mixed 1:1 by volume
which is a lot less hassle if you can get it conveniently.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-17-16-57-51-2/"><img alt="Finished, primed, painted" class="size-full wp-image-81" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-17-16-57-51-2.jpeg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /></a></p>
<p>Once the resin was cured and cracked out of the mould I trimmed off the
flashing where the mould halves joined and primed them with grey spray
on primer. &nbsp;At this point I noticed the woodgrain had transferred
through from some parts of the bodies and other parts were not so
smooth. To fix this I used some filler and a few rounds of
sanding/filing and re-priming until I was happy with the finish.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2012/12/28/mittens-and-snowdrop-action-figures/2012-12-17-17-15-01/"><img alt="Paints" class="size-full wp-image-82" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-17-17-15-01.jpeg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a></p>
<p>Finally I painted the models with a mix of Citadel and Vallejo paints I
had to hand and varnished them with some EzeCote polyurethane.</p>
