</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've had a Precedent Hi-Fly model glider lying around waiting to be
repaired for years now. I originally built it with my dad. Well, he did
most of the building; I suspect my main contribution was nagging him to
get it finished. Unfortunately, we didn't really know what we were
doing, and it took some damage after very little flight time. We
attempted to use a plastic AA battery box which broke as we launched the
glider and left us with no control.</p>

Before[/caption]</p>
<p>The nose of the model was damaged when it landed, and it was put in
storage for many years, during which the wings got warped. A year or so
ago I decided to restore it, I finally made a start on it last week.</p>
<p>I decided to completely rebuild the wings, as the warp in the originals
was enough that it would be very difficult to remove without weakening
them. First off I dug out the plans and found an image showing the
typical wing section. I traced this in Draftsight to provide the shape
for the various wing ribs. The tip ribs where the wing tapers had to be
generated by measuring the plan, then scaling and fixing up the slots.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_105&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1160&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/screen-shot-2013-02-02-at-21-51-38/"><img alt="Ribs redrawn in Draftsight" class="size-full wp-image-105" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Screen-shot-2013-02-02-at-21.51.38.png" style="width: 1160px; height: 574px;" /></a> Ribs redrawn in Draftsight[/caption]</p>
<p>Unfortunately in my hurry to get the ribs cut I drew them in a hurry and
made a few mistakes. I missed the asymmetrical spar slots on the inner
ribs and added a slot where the shear webs were drawn on the plan,
leaving me with two part ribs. I didn't catch this before laser cutting
the parts, but I was able to work around the problems and avoid wasting
the cut parts. I guess the moral of the story is &quot;Don't design in a
hurry&quot;. The drawing shown above includes the corrections I made later.
The thin ply end plates had to be cut by hand around a template as I
couldn't find laser safe 1/32&quot; ply.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_117&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-22-23-50-10/"><img alt="Cut ribs" class="wp-image-117" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-22-23.50.10.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Cut ribs[/caption]</p>
<p>I traced the plan onto some greaseproof paper since the original plan
was too creased to build on top of.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_118&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-27-17-28-48-2/"><img alt="Layout" class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-27-17.28.481.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /></a>
Layout[/caption]</p>
<p>The actual wings went together fairly quickly once I got started. The
spars were pinned to the board and the 1/8th inch ply and balsa inner
ribs were laid on top. They were packed to sit level because they're cut
1/16th of an inch undersize so they can be sheeted later. I then added
then top spar and supported it at the other end. A small template was
used to set the angle of the root rib, to give the wing the correct
amount of dihedral.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_120&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-27-18-03-30-2/"><img alt="Inner ribs" class="size-full wp-image-120" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-27-18.03.301.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Inner ribs[/caption]</p>
<p>Between each pair of ribs is a shear web that locks the spars together,
and prevents the wing from twisting or flexing. These came in handy to
hold the front end of the ribs in place, meanwhile the rear ends of the
ribs were pinned. A set of building block blanks from Homebase came in
handy to make sure everything was square. I tend to clamp them to parts
until the glue sets to keep them oriented correctly. Fortunately I had
enough clamps that by the time I ran out the glue on the first pieces
was dry, so the clamps could be reused and the build went fairly
quickly.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_122&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-02-01-20-47-03/"><img alt="Lots of clamps" class="size-full wp-image-122" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-01-20.47.03.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Lots of clamps[/caption]</p>
<p>Once the rear ribs were in place, I marked the positions of their ends
on a piece of trailing edge stock. I cut out notches then glued and
pinned it to the board. This kept the rear ribs safe while I moved on to
the front section of the wing.</p>
<p>Due to the mistakes I made when drawing the parts, the inner ribs were
1/16th of an inch longer than the outer ribs. To work around this I
glued a strip of 1/16th balsa to the rear of the leading edge stock I
was using, stopping where it met the inner ribs. I glued this to the
inner ribs and pinned and clamped it in place, then installed the front
rib half at the tip of the wing. This had to be clamped in in place with
a pair of building blocks to keep it at the right angle. I then pinned
the leading edge to the board to make sure it was straight according to
my drawn layout before fitting the rest of the front rib halves.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_123&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-01-27-20-57-55-3/"><img alt="Front rib halves" class="size-full wp-image-123" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-01-27-20.57.552.jpg" style="width: 460px; height: 768px;" /></a> Front rib halves[/caption]</p>
<p>Once the ribs were installed, I had to do some sanding to fix my design
mistakes. I then fitted a piece of sheeting between the spar and the
leading edge on the top side of the wing. This is designed to be glued
into the top of the leading edge and then sanded to blend it in later.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_124&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/02/02/model-glider-restoration/2013-02-02-18-42-40/"><img alt="Leading edge sheeting" class="size-full wp-image-124" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-02-18.42.40.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 613px;" /></a> Leading edge sheeting[/caption]</p>
<p>Once sanded, the sheeting gives a very neat and uniform look, which
hides many of the problems caused by the drawing issues. The curved tips
play a perspective trick in the photo above, making the sheeting look
flatter than it is.</p>
<p>The next task on the wings is to build up the tips and install the inner
sheeting. I also need to drill a hole in the inner ribs to hold a tube
into which the wire wing joiner will slide. Later, I will need to fix up
the fuselage, but this should be a simpler job.</p>
