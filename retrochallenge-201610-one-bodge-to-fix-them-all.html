</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's two days past the deadline, but I found an extra moment to work on
my SD card interface today and I have it working!</p>
<p>I switched the clock output to the SD card from SH_CLK to /SH_CLK to
move the rising edge of the clock to a point where the output from the
shift register is stable, and now it works nicely.</p>

<p>This eliminated the critical timing that the Bus Pirate was have gotten
away with but my circuit did not.</p>

<p>Once I had this working I checked that the 74HCT595 was clocking the
data coming back from the SD correctly. Since my test program soft
resets the rc2014 when it finishes I was able to check this from BASIC.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_1030&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2016/11/02/retrochallenge-201610-one-bodge-to-fix-them-all/img_20161102_200739-jpg-sm/"><img alt="Reading back the response" class="size-full wp-image-1030" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_20161102_200739.jpg.sm_.jpg" style="width: 1024px; height: 766px;" /></a> Reading back the response[/caption]</p>
<p>Now that this is working I need to write a (less messy) program to fully
initialise the SD card and switch to fast mode. Once that is done I will
verify the schematic by rebuilding the circuit on stripboard from the
schematic, before designing a proper PCB for the circuit including a
proper SD card socket.</p>
<p>There are also a couple of potential minor hardware improvements to
investigate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As noted in my last post that it's likely that I can get rid of the
second 74HCT374 and switch to just using the simple edge trigger
circuit.</li>
<li>Fast mode should be pretty optimal when used with the Z80 OTIR
instruction to write many bytes of data from memory straight to an IO
port, however for reading data from the card I currently need to
alternate writing 0xff and then read the result back with with an IN
instruction. I can use the INI instruction to automatically keep
track of where the read bytes should go in memory but I can't use the
INIR instruction which would be faster. Some extra logic to
(optionally) trigger a write after a read would allow me to use INIR
to read blocks of data with the implicit write priming the input
shift register with the next byte after each read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, here's the final schematic:</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_1032&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1488&quot;]<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2016/11/02/retrochallenge-201610-one-bodge-to-fix-them-all/z80_sd_interface-sch-2/"><img alt="Final Schematic" class="size-full wp-image-1032" src="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/z80_sd_interface.sch_.png" style="width: 1488px; height: 1052px;" /></a> Final Schematic[/caption]</p>
<p>Even though I didn't quite get it done within the deadline I can call
this RetroChallenge a success (it was definitely good motivation).</p>
<p>For bonus points I managed to use exactly all the gates in the 7400 quad
NAND and 7404 hex inverter that make up my glue logic.</p>
<p>Now it's probably time to start reading the CP/M BIOS Alteration Guide!</p>
