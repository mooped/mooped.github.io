</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's not moop today but me again returning as a guest contributor. So,
it's not planes or lathes today but wireless plugs and stuff.</p>
<p>If you read my last blog post
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/05/27/homemade-wireless-plug/">http://www.moop.org.uk/index.php/2013/05/27/homemade-wireless-plug/</a>)&nbsp;you'll
know that I tried building a cheap Bluetooth controlled plug socket
that'd fit in a standard back box. When it came to actually installing
though I got cold feet. There are safety and legal issue to fitting
something like that into the wall so instead I opted for a commercially
available version. I choose the LightwaveRF range of plug sockets and
dimmer switches. These are just like what I was designing in that they
just replace the standard fittings and are switchable remotely. With the
LightwaveRF Wireless Controller this also includes controlling them
across the network. They are pricey compared to my design but on the
other hand, look a lot nicer and far less likely to catch fire.</p>
<p>The LightwaveRF network protocol is a fairly simple UDP scheme that's
very easy to hook into (<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.networkedsolutions.co.uk/?p=149">http://blog.networkedsolutions.co.uk/?p=149</a>).
The only strangeness is having to send a message with ID 533 first time
to get the LightwaveRF box to prompt to register a new device. Coding
this only took a few minutes and once that was working the only thing
left was to think of something to do with it!</p>
<p>The most obvious thing to me was to live out Star Trek
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE</a>)&nbsp;by controlling things in my
house by talking to them. &quot;Computer, lights on&quot; for example. I didn't
want to leave a computer running all the time but I did have a Raspberry
Pi lying around which I've been wanting to find a use for.</p>
<p>So, I started by looking for voice recognition technology to use. Doing
a quick Google, bought up a lot of suggestions to use Google's voice API
(they would say that! ;)). As much as I like Google, I don't really want
everything I ever say getting sent to their servers, so that was out.
Next best choice seemed to be CMU Sphinx. pocketsphinx is designed for
embedded systems so seemed a good fit for the Pi.</p>
<p>On first impressions I was very unimpressed with CMU Sphinx. The
accuracy of recognition seemed absolutely terrible. However it does have
facilities to work with a subset of words for doing digit recognition
for example. With a text file of commands I wanted it to recognise the
lmtool (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html</a>) creates all
the files needed. Using these files the quality of recognition improved
considerably. However there were still problems distinguishing &quot;on&quot; and
&quot;off&quot;. Also the word &quot;Computer&quot; was frequently misunderstood. So
accepting this as a limitation of voice control, &quot;Computer, lights on&quot;
became &quot;Jeeves, lights up&quot;. Finally I adapted the voice model
(<a class="reference external" href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialadapt">http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialadapt</a>) which improved the
voice recognition even further.</p>
<p>Up until this point I'd been doing everything on my laptop but moving
this to the Pi was fairly straight forward. I now needed some sort of
microphone though. I tried Singstar mics at first. These worked straight
off but didn't really do a very good job unless speaking directly into
them. So next I tried another of my discarded game accessories, a PS3
Eye camera. This worked much better when picking up sound from across
the room.</p>
<p>For sound output I used a pair of cheap PC speakers which I could
connect to the 3.5mm audio jack on the Pi. I had spent some time trying
to sort out a problem where the first second or so of audio when using
HDMI output was silent. I tried updating the firmware and googled around
for the answer. In the end I worked around this by appending a second of
silence to the start of my audio output with sox. However when using the
speakers the problem just went away anyway much to my relief.</p>
<p>As a finishing touch I made a quick LED display to indicate when the Pi
was ready to accept the next command. While doing this, I decided to
also wire up an IR LED so I could control the television too. Not having
IR LEDs in my parts draw I just cracked open an old remote and took the
LED out of there. I connect this to GPIO 7 as an arbitrary clock can be
generated on that pin. I used this to provide the 38KHz modulation
needed for my TV. I then toggled that pin between clock and a zero
output in software to encode the commands to control the TV. This did
not work at first. I could see on my laptop's webcam that the IR LED was
flashing away but the TV did not respond. Cracking out the oscilloscope
I found that the pulses when the output was a clock were all around
200us too long. I assume this is due to a delay in toggling the state. I
decided to take the easy way out and just adjusted these timings. After
these adjustments I was successfully able to control my TV using just an
IR LED and a resister.</p>
<p>So enough talk, here it is in action...</p>

<p>Nb. The source is downloadable here&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/lightwave.zip">Lightwave
Source</a>.&nbsp;I
warn you now though it's some pretty ugly code. A lot of this coding was
done crouched on the floor working directly on the Pi. Getting back off
the floor was my top priority, not following any coding standards. Still
thought I should include it just in case anyone wanted some reference.
The main guts, speech.c is just a modified version of the pocketsphinx
continuous speech sample. irTrans turns the TV on and off and
lightwave.c deals with the network side of things. speaker.c just keeps
festival open so I don't have to pay the start up time when doing voice
synthesis. Hope it's helpful to someone.</p>
