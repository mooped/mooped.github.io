With the wings complete I moved on to restoring the fuselage of the
glider. I'd originally intended to Â use the existing fuselage and just
straighten it up. Unfortunately, when I came to look at it closer the
plywood construction had warped more than I thought. I started trying to
disassemble it with a view to re-glueing but it quickly fell apart, at
this point it became even more obvious that the original ply was just
too warped to be useful. I took the decision to build a new fuselage
using as many of the existing parts as possible, but using balsa instead
of ply for the majority of the structure. I decided it should be
possible to build a structure with equivalent strength this way, with
similar or less weight and less tendency to warp if stored for a long
time.

The first step was to trace out the layout of the fuselage from the
plans. This was tricky because the way the plans were folded (in the
original packaging) they would not sit flat. They had to be stretched
very tightly to avoid introducing curves into the lines. I took account
of this when tracing and did a second pass using measurements from the
plan and filling in the straight edges.

Once I was happy with the outlines I traced them onto some balsa. The
fuselage sides were cut at the same time by pinning and double sided
taping two sheets together, in order to ensure that they matched. The
edges were then sanded before detaching the sheets. Because my wings
have a slightly longer chord I had to transfer some measurements from
the new wings onto the fuselage sides. I then used the markings on the
fuselage sides to determine the length of the top sheeting.

I was unable to reuse the original fuselage formers. In the course of
removing the glue from them the wood began to crumble, also the
thickness of the side sheeting had changed necessitating different
dimensions for the formers. I built a servo tray shelf from thick balsa
instead of ply to avoid the difficulties of cutting this part out of
ply.

For the front section of the fuselage I cut some 1/32" ply formers to
add back some strength. The were overlapped with the front former but
did not go beyond.

doublers| Ply doublers[/caption]

I then fitted the new formers using blocks to make sure they were at
right angles with the fuselage sides. The rear of the doublers was glued
into place at this point, but the remainder was left unglued to make it
easy to add curvature to this section later.

Once the glue was cured the other side of the fuselage was fitted to the
formers, again ensuring that everything was held perpendicular. Once
this was set I put the fuselage upside down and began fitting the bottom
sheeting, making sure that the fuselage sides were vertical at each
point.

the bottom sheeting| Adding the bottom sheeting[/caption]

With the majority of the fuselage bottom sheeting installed I had to fit
pushrods before closing this area up. A sharpened aluminium tube worked
well to drill out the angle pushrod exit holes in the fuselage. The
pushrod outer tubing was roughed up and epoxied into place at the rear
of the fuselage and held in place with rubber tubing at the front.

The bottom sheeting in the nose section is thicker than in other areas
and is sanded to provide a curved shape. I first traced out the shape I
wanted and pinned and glued the fuselage sides into position using this
template. I also glued the rest of the doublers down at this point to
help maintain the curvature. Once the glue was cured I trimmed the
bottom sheeting to shape.

bottom sheeting| Nose bottom sheeting[/caption]

To create a servo tray in the nose section of the fuselage I transferred
the dimensions of the rear part of the tray (attached to the former) to
a square stick of wood. I then used a servo and a piece of 3/16 sheet
that would become the front of the tray to mark out the required
dimensions. I used the stick to mark the inside of the fuselage sides
with the tray position, then used pins to transfer these marks to the
outside. Cutting a slot between the marks gave me a firm mounting for
the front of the servo tray. This was glued in after the servos were
screwed into it to maintain good alignment with the rear of the tray.
The ends of this piece were then trimmed and sanded flush with the
fuselage sides.

[gallery ids="190,191,192"]

To create the nose of the glider I first installed a ply former between
the fronts of the fuselage sides. I the attached a stack of 3/16" balsa
forming the rough shape of the glider's nose. These were hacked roughly
to shape with a razor saw before being sanded to a smooth shape that I
was happy with.

[gallery columns="4" ids="194,195,197,199"]

The wing saddle area felt a little flimsy so it was reinforced with two
sections of 1/4" square section balsa on either side. These should help
transfer loads across this section of the model and provide a sturdier
support for the wing.

As with the nose, I built up a block of balsa at the very rear of the
glider and sanded it to shape. This gives a neat finish to the tail as
well as hopefully absorbing any impacts during transport and handling.

The fin was fitted last to avoid bashing it while working on other parts
of the model. I was glued into a slot in the top sheeting, and held in
place with blocks while the glue cured. I used the original fin as this
part was still intact and straight.

Covering the fuselage was a straightforward process as there are no open
sections to cover over.

With the majority of the fuselage built I fitted the original rudder and
stabiliser to the model. The rudder was fitted with 3M Blenderm tape
which makes an excellent hinge. The stabiliser and wings are intended to
be held on with thick rubber bands, I need to go out and buy some
stronger bands before flying the model. After centering the servos I
trimmed the pushrods to length and fitted clevises, then tested the
amount of force required to move the control surfaces. The rudder
required quite a bit of force so I moved the control horn lower down on
the rudder to better suit the angle of the pushrod.

Unfortunately I don't have access to a decent slope or any good means of
launching the model as a pure glider. The HiFly comes with a motor pod
that sits above the wing so it can be flown as a powered glider. I've
assembled the pod, but I'm waiting on the arrival of a motor before I
can fly it.

At this point I was able to fully assemble the model, which took up a
lot more space than I remember. Various parts like the canopy and the
stabiliser were reused from the original model. Once the motor arrives
(hopefully next week) I'll be able to give it a test flight assuming the
weather cooperates.
