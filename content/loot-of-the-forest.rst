I just finished participating in the 28th Ludum Dare game jam. This time
around the theme was 'You Only Get One'.

I chose to interpret this fairly literally as a game mechanic and came
up with Loot of the Forest. It's a game about bribing forest guardian
creatures as you make your way through their forest maze, but you only
have a single item per species of guardian.

Expect puzzles and weird animal based puns.

Play it

The game was written in HTML5/Javascript, with graphics drawn in GIMP,
and sound effects generated by the awesome ` <http://www.bfxr.net/>`__.
It was fueled by sleep deprivation and cold pizza.
