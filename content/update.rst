I've had a sudden burst of motivation this morning, possibly due to a
nice model flying day finally turning up (maybe the second this year!).
I thought I'd use this to make a post since I've not updated in a while.
I have a bunch of projects on the go, but they're all moving rather
slowly.

For months now I've been building another R/C model, a `Speed Twin
ST2 <http://www.speedtwin.co.uk/>`__. The full size is a nifty looking
and rather rare (2 prototypes made, one sold to someone in the US) twin
prop aerobatic plane. It's somewhat of a departure for me as, with the
exception of the HiFly, it's a lot larger than any of the models I've
previously built. The plane was built from free plans in `RCM&E
Magazine <http://www.modelflying.co.uk/forums/postings.asp?th=65621>`__,
designed by Tim Hooper. I'm cheating a bit by using a CNC cut short kit
they offer. Once I find some time I'll hopefully make a series of posts
on the construction process.

Work on the Speed Twin has mostly stalled for the past few months. This
was due to a holiday immediately followed by the arrival of my eShapeOko
CNC machine, which stole a large chunk of my working space. In the short
term, I'm planning on using the machine to experiment with mechanical
PCB etching. The controller for the machine is currently built on a
breadboard. If all goes to plan it'll be used to build itself a more
permanent controller, and a nice housing for it too.

The controller is based on an Arduino running
`GRBL <https://github.com/grbl/grbl>`__ and four
`EasyDriver <http://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/>`__ stepper
controller boards. The DIY Arduino (made during a workshop at Nottingham
Hackspace) doesn't include a USB to serial adapter, so I've hacked one
together using a Minimus USB microcontroller board.

Unfortunately, I'm waiting on some PCB milling bits to be delivered,
along with a few other parts, before I can use it in anger. Experiments
with it acting as a pencil plotter are promising, and the accuracy seems
more than sufficient for the job.

I'll hopefully write a few posts about some of the mods I've done to the
machine shortly, and about building the final version of the controller
once the parts arrive.

Last but not least, I've resumed work on the Unholy Chalupa, my own
design model aircraft. The original Chalupa is a 22" span low wing
trainer I designed in early 2012 and built over the Easter bank holiday
weekend that year. It was designed in CAD but the parts were hand cut.

|Original Chalupa|

The original model flew well but the wing was overly delicate and became
quite twisted after a few repairs. After shelving the model for a few
months I redrew the wing with laser cutting in mind. I borrowed a lot of
ideas from the style of `Dave
Thacker's <http://www.radicalrc.com/category/Radical-RC-E-Kits-190>`__
micro scale models, which I'm rather fond of.

|Laser cut MKII wing|

The new laser cut wing flew nicely initially, but was lightly built for
this model. This wing broke during a crash caused by the motor working
its way loose from the mount in flight. The wing was repaired, but due
to one piece construction it was never really straight after that,
making the plane less fun to fly.

The new design has a simplified two part wing that will plug into the
sides of the fuselage. This will limit any damage taken to a single wing
panel. Since this design change will require a new fuselage, I took the
opportunity to redesign that too. The new design will be a lot less
boxy.

I have the parts cut for the new design now, I'll post more about it
once I get around to putting it together.
