While building my model SpeedTwin ST2 I needed to neatly cut some foam.
Since I had a bunch of 6mm laser safe ply available and needed to cut
some other bits the next day I decided to design my own hot wire cutter
and cut the parts out at the same time.

The cutter is designed to be built around some 1/2inch spruce engine
bearer stock that I had lying around. Any roughly 1/2inch square section
wood will work so long as it is stiff enough.

Most of the parts are designed to be built from 6mm ply, with a few 3mm
bits. 6mm, 3mm and 2mm bolts are used to attach the fittings to the
wood. Some nichrome wire is used as the heating element, with some stiff
wire on the other side to tension the cutting wire. I added some springs
to help maintain the tension as the wire stretches. These would work
better on the other side to that shown in the photos to increase the
amount of wire available for cutting.

I've found lots of articles online about DIY hot wire cutters that
suggest using a transformer connected directly to mains, with no current
limiting or anything. DO NOT DO THIS. Those people are idiots (and
they're most likely in a country with a lower mains voltage). I've been
running my hot wire from a lab power supply in current limited mode and
it works nicely and gives excellent control over the temperature of the
wire.

I've uploaded the DraftSight files to `my GitHub
account <https://github.com/mooped/hotwire>`__ for anyone who is
interested in them, but please bear in mind the finished product could
be dangerous and I take no responsibility for what you do with it.
