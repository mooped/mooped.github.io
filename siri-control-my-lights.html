</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Once again, it's not moop but Charlie, so we're talking home automation
instead of planes.</p>
<p>My last video on home automation turned out to be surprisingly popular!
So, to celebrate I've done a quick follow up on the same idea. One thing
people commented on was that I should have used SiriProxy. I had
considered this when writing Jeeves
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZkwvSX0_Os">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZkwvSX0_Os</a>). I felt it wasn't quite as
cool as having a device that listens all the time though. However,
SiriProxy doesn't seem to require a huge amount of processor time so can
run happily next to Jeeves even on a Raspberry Pi, so I thought I'd give
it a go.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/Z7gtugR2umI">http://youtu.be/Z7gtugR2umI</a></p>
<p>Setting up was amazingly easy. I basically followed the instructions
verbatim from the main SiriProxy page
(<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy">https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy</a>). There's a lot of complicated
guides for old versions of SiriProxy but the latest version is quite
simple to setup, so just follow the instructions from the main page.</p>
<p>The only thing I did differently to the instructions was that I had to
copy my .siriproxy directory from my user directory to /root/.siriproxy.
This is probably because when I generated the certificates, I wasn't
root. You should be able to run SiriProxy as an unprivileged user but I
didn't get that to work. It's only on the Pi so, I don't have any
reservations about running SiriProxy as root anyway, so I just went with
it.</p>
<p>Once the Pi was set up and running, all that was left was to set up my
phone. This required e-mailing the generated certificate and changing
the WiFi settings so that the DNS server pointed at the Pi.</p>
<p>With that working, next was the fun part of actually making a plugin for
SiriProxy so it would do my bidding. There's already a LightwaveRF
plugin but what's the fun of being like everyone else! Naturally I wrote
my own. It's might be worse that the existing plugin, I didn't check
before writing my own version.</p>
<p>The first hurdle to overcome was that the plugins need writing in Ruby.
I'd never even seen Ruby code until I wrote the plugin so I probably
didn't do things in the most efficient way but it was easy to get
something working.</p>
<p>The main bulk of the plugin consists of these clauses...</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
listen_for /some regex/ do |variables,to,store,matches|
&nbsp; say &quot;Hey I recognised that&quot;
&nbsp; request_completed
end
</pre>
<p>Adding the lightwaveRF UDP protocol was easy from Ruby. First a socket
is created and the host/port set up with...</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
s = UDPSocket.new
port = 9760
host = &quot;192.168.0.10&quot;
</pre>
<p>To turn on a device can then be done with only one line...</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
s.send(&quot;000,!R1D1F1|Siri|On&quot;, 0, host, port)
</pre>
<p>Each room contains a list of sockets that it has. When saying &quot;There is
a desklamp in the left socket&quot;, it first matches via a regular
expression and extracts the two important bits, &quot;desklamp&quot; and &quot;left
socket&quot;. Next it verifies that &quot;left socket&quot; is a socket it knows about.
If it is, then it inserts a new entry into the &quot;items&quot; hash map linking
&quot;desklamp&quot; to the left socket.</p>
<p>When you say &quot;Turn on desklamp&quot;, the word &quot;desklamp&quot; is looked up in the
items hash map. If it finds a match then it sends the required command
to the socket it was registered with. If it doesn't find anything in the
map then it will check for a socket called &quot;desklamp&quot;. Being a lazy
programmer, the lights use this trick as they are implemented as just
another socket. I could say &quot;There is a banana in the lights&quot; and I
would be able to turn on my lights by saying &quot;Switch on banana&quot;. That
sort of bug, I don't mind letting slip through though as it's a remote
possibility anyone would try.</p>
<p>I think that pretty much covers it. I hope someone finds it fun and has
a go at implementing their own system.</p>
